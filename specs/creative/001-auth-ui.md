# ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX Design - Authentication

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
We need a clean, intuitive, and secure user interface for user registration and login. The design should be simple enough for quick implementation but professional enough for a good user experience.

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Minimalist Single-Page Forms
**Description**: A single-page layout with a card-based form that toggles between registration and login.
**Pros**:
- Simple to implement.
- Clean and modern look.
- Low cognitive load for users.
**Cons**:
- May not be as visually engaging as other options.
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: ~2-3 hours

### Option 2: Multi-Step Wizard
**Description**: A multi-step form for registration (e.g., step 1 for email/password, step 2 for profile info).
**Pros**:
- Breaks down the registration process into smaller chunks.
- Can feel less overwhelming for users.
**Cons**:
- More complex to implement.
- Can be frustrating if users want to go back and change information.
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: ~4-6 hours

### Option 3: Social Login Integration
**Description**: In addition to email/password, allow users to register/login with Google, GitHub, etc.
**Pros**:
- Reduces friction for users.
- Can improve security by leveraging established providers.
**Cons**:
- Adds complexity to the backend and frontend.
- Requires managing OAuth flows.
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: ~8-12 hours

## DECISION
We will go with **Option 1: Minimalist Single-Page Forms**. This approach provides the best balance of simplicity, user experience, and implementation speed for the initial phase of the project. We can always add social login later as a feature improvement.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. Create a single `Auth.tsx` component that will render the login and registration forms.
2. Use a state variable to toggle between the `login` and `register` views.
3. Use a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a clean and responsive design.
4. The form will be centered on the page with a card-like container.
5. Input fields will have clear labels and placeholders.
6. A single button will be used for both login and registration, with the text changing based on the current view.
7. Error messages will be displayed below the input fields in case of validation errors.
