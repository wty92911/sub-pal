## **Project Specification: Subscription Service Management Panel**

### **Overview**

This project aims to create a Subscription Service Management Panel that helps users manage their subscriptions, track spending, and monitor subscription cycles. The system will allow users to add, remove, or pause subscriptions, set payment periods, and view statistics on subscription costs over time.

### **Target Audience**

This tool is designed for individuals who want to manage their various subscriptions from multiple services (e.g., streaming services, news outlets, software subscriptions) in one place.

### **Core Features**

1. **User Management**

   * **Registration/Login**: Users can sign up with their email address, and log in securely. Users will be able to manage their account and reset passwords.

     * Technologies: Rust for backend authentication (e.g., Actix-web or Rocket), React for the frontend interface.
   * **Profile Management**: Users can update personal details and change their email/password.

2. **Subscription Management**

   * **Add Subscriptions**: Users can manually add subscriptions from various external services by specifying:

     * Subscription name
     * Start date
     * Subscription cycle (daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, yearly)
     * Cost of subscription
   * **Edit Subscription**: Users can edit the subscription details if there are changes.
   * **Pause Subscription**: Option to pause a subscription, stopping the billing cycle.
   * **Delete Subscription**: Users can remove a subscription entirely.

3. **Statistics and Reporting**

   * **Monthly/Yearly Expense Statistics**: Display a breakdown of subscription expenses by month or year.
   * **Average Expense Calculation**: Show the average monthly/yearly subscription costs.
   * **Recurring Cost Analysis**: Graphs and visualizations to track spending over time.
   * **Export Data**: Option to export the statistics as a CSV or PDF report.

4. **User Interface**

   * **Responsive Design**: The panel should be accessible from both web and mobile interfaces.
   * **Dashboard**: A clean, user-friendly dashboard showing all subscriptions with relevant information (name, cycle, cost, status).
   * **Notifications**: Alerts when a subscription is about to renew or needs attention.
   * **Search and Filter**: Users can search for subscriptions by name, status, or category.

5. **Security**

   * **Authentication**: Ensure secure user registration, login, and session management.
   * **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive user data, including payment and account details.
   * **Authorization**: Ensure only authenticated users can access their subscriptions and statistics.

### **Project Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1: Initial Setup and User Authentication**

   * Set up the backend with Rust (using Actix-web or Rocket for web handling).
   * Implement user registration and authentication system.
   * Design frontend in React (with authentication system, login, and signup screens).
   * Implement database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user and subscription data.

2. **Phase 2: Subscription Management System**

   * Create CRUD functionality for adding, editing, pausing, and deleting subscriptions.
   * Implement subscription cycles and payment tracking.
   * Design the user interface for managing subscriptions (add/edit screens, subscription list view).

3. **Phase 3: Statistics and Reporting**

   * Implement statistical calculations and data visualization (average costs, monthly/yearly expenses).
   * Create graphs and charts for expense analysis (using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for React).
   * Add export feature (CSV/PDF).

4. **Phase 4: Finalization and Security Enhancements**

   * Implement encryption and data security measures.
   * Conduct usability testing and make adjustments based on feedback.
   * Optimize for mobile and desktop performance.
   * Deploy the application and monitor user feedback.

5. **Phase 5: Future Improvements**

   * Integrate third-party APIs for automatic subscription tracking (e.g., for Netflix, Spotify).
   * Add payment gateway for subscription renewals.
   * Provide detailed notifications about upcoming subscription renewals.

### **Technical Requirements**

* **Backend**: Rust (using frameworks like Actix-web or Rocket for API handling)
* **Frontend**: React (with state management via Redux or Context API)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing user and subscription data
* **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure login and session management
* **Visualization Libraries**: Chart.js or Recharts for data visualizations
* **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, AWS/GCP for hosting, or a VPS server for deployment

### **User Stories**

1. **As a user**, I want to sign up and log in securely, so that I can manage my subscriptions.
2. **As a user**, I want to add a new subscription by specifying details such as name, start date, cycle, and cost, so that I can track it in the app.
3. **As a user**, I want to see a visual representation of my subscription spending over time, so that I can manage my budget.
4. **As a user**, I want to pause or delete subscriptions, so that I can easily control my recurring expenses.
5. **As a user**, I want to receive notifications about upcoming subscription renewals, so that I can take action before I'm charged.

### **Challenges and Risks**

* **Data Security**: Ensuring that all user data, especially payment information, is stored securely.
* **Third-party Integrations**: Integrating with external services might require significant effort, particularly if automatic subscription tracking is desired.
* **Scalability**: The system should be scalable to handle increasing numbers of users and subscriptions without performance degradation.
