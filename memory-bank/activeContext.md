- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state management
- **Visualization**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## Current Phase
Initial setup phase with basic project structure established. The project has:
- Basic Rust backend with minimal server setup
- Frontend React application with dependencies installed
- Project requirements documented

## Key Features to Implement
1. User authentication system
2. Subscription CRUD operations
3. Statistical analysis and visualization
4. Notification system
5. Data export functionality

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a client-server architecture with:
- RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- Component-based frontend structure
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Secure authentication flow
