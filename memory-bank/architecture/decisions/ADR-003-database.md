# Architecture Decision Record: Selection of PostgreSQL for Database

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Subscription Service Management Panel requires a database solution that can reliably store and manage user data, subscription information, payment records, and other application data. The database choice impacts data integrity, query performance, scalability, and development productivity.

Key considerations:
- Data integrity and consistency requirements
- Query complexity and performance
- Schema flexibility and evolution
- Scalability needs
- Integration with the Rust backend
- Development and operational experience

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for the application.

### Technology Stack Details:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **ORM/Query Builder**: SQLx with type-safe queries
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling via SQLx
- **Migration Tool**: SQLx migrations or a dedicated migration tool
- **Integration**: Direct integration with Rust backend via SQLx

## Consequences

### Advantages:
1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL provides strong transactional guarantees ensuring data consistency.
2. **Rich Feature Set**: Supports complex queries, joins, window functions, and advanced SQL features.
3. **JSON Support**: Native JSON/JSONB support for flexible schema needs (e.g., user preferences).
4. **Type System**: Strong, extensible type system that aligns well with Rust's type system.
5. **Indexing Options**: Multiple indexing strategies for query optimization.
6. **Ecosystem**: Mature ecosystem with excellent tools for administration, monitoring, and backup.
7. **SQLx Integration**: Strong Rust support via SQLx with compile-time query checking.
8. **Scalability**: Supports read replicas, connection pooling, and partitioning for horizontal scaling.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Operational Complexity**: Requires more operational knowledge than simpler databases or managed services.
2. **Resource Usage**: Higher resource requirements compared to lighter database solutions.
3. **Schema Migrations**: Schema changes require careful planning and execution.
4. **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with PostgreSQL may need training.

### Mitigations:
1. Implement comprehensive database administration documentation
2. Use connection pooling to optimize resource usage
3. Establish a robust schema migration process
4. Provide PostgreSQL and SQLx training resources for the team

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL/MariaDB
- **Pros**: Widely used, good performance, familiar to many developers
- **Cons**: Less advanced features than PostgreSQL, less ideal JSON support
- **Reason for rejection**: PostgreSQL offers better JSON support and type system for our needs

### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Schema flexibility, easier horizontal scaling, good JSON document support
- **Cons**: Weaker consistency guarantees, less mature query optimization
- **Reason for rejection**: Our data has clear relational aspects that benefit from SQL and ACID transactions

### SQLite
- **Pros**: Simplicity, zero configuration, embedded operation
- **Cons**: Limited concurrency, not suitable for high-traffic production use
- **Reason for rejection**: Insufficient for production multi-user workloads

### DynamoDB or other NoSQL
- **Pros**: Highly scalable, managed service options
- **Cons**: Query limitations, eventual consistency model, less familiar to team
- **Reason for rejection**: Relational nature of our data and need for complex queries

## Related Decisions
- ADR-001: Selection of Rust with Axum for backend (influences database integration)
- ADR-005: Layered architecture approach (influences data access patterns)

## Notes
This decision should be revisited if:
- Data volume grows beyond what PostgreSQL can efficiently handle
- Query patterns evolve to favor a different database paradigm
- Operational challenges with PostgreSQL become significant
