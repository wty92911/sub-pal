# Architecture Decision Record: JWT for Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Subscription Service Management Panel requires a secure authentication mechanism to identify users, protect their data, and control access to the application's features. The authentication approach impacts security, user experience, scalability, and system complexity.

Key considerations:
- Security of user credentials and sessions
- Statelessness for horizontal scaling
- User experience during login and session management
- Integration with both backend and frontend
- Support for future features like SSO or OAuth providers
- Operational simplicity

## Decision
We will implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for the application.

### Technology Stack Details:
- **Token Format**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Token Storage**: Client-side storage (localStorage/secure cookies)
- **Token Validation**: Server-side validation with middleware
- **Password Storage**: Secure hashing with bcrypt or Argon2
- **Token Refresh**: Refresh token mechanism for extended sessions
- **Implementation**: Custom JWT implementation using established libraries

## Consequences

### Advantages:
1. **Statelessness**: JWTs are self-contained and don't require server-side session storage, supporting horizontal scaling.
2. **Flexibility**: Can include custom claims and user information directly in the token.
3. **Cross-Domain**: Works well across different domains and in distributed systems.
4. **Performance**: Reduces database lookups for session validation.
5. **Standards-Based**: Uses established standards with good library support.
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Works well with mobile applications and APIs.
7. **Expiration Control**: Built-in expiration mechanism.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Token Size**: JWTs can be larger than session IDs, increasing request size.
2. **Revocation Challenges**: Immediate token revocation requires additional mechanisms.
3. **Client-Side Storage Risks**: Potential security concerns with client-side token storage.
4. **Complexity**: More complex to implement correctly than simple session-based auth.

### Mitigations:
1. Keep token payload minimal to reduce size
2. Implement short expiration times with refresh token pattern
3. Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for token storage when possible
4. Maintain a token blacklist for critical revocation needs
5. Follow security best practices for JWT implementation

## Alternatives Considered

### Session-Based Authentication
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, easier revocation, smaller cookies/headers
- **Cons**: Requires server-side session storage, potential scaling issues
- **Reason for rejection**: Less suitable for stateless API architecture and horizontal scaling

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- **Pros**: Standardized protocol, supports third-party authentication
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, potentially overkill for our needs
- **Reason for rejection**: Additional complexity without immediate benefit, can be added later

### API Keys
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, good for service-to-service authentication
- **Cons**: Less suitable for user authentication, limited features
- **Reason for rejection**: Not designed for end-user authentication use cases

## Related Decisions
- ADR-001: Selection of Rust with Axum for backend (influences auth implementation)
- ADR-002: Selection of React with TypeScript for frontend (influences token handling)
- ADR-005: Layered architecture approach (influences auth middleware placement)

## Notes
This decision should be revisited if:
- Security requirements change significantly
- We need to support third-party authentication providers
- Token size becomes problematic for performance
- Revocation requirements become more stringent
