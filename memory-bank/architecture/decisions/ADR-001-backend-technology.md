# Architecture Decision Record: Selection of Rust with Axum for Backend

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Subscription Service Management Panel requires a backend technology that can handle API requests, process business logic, and interact with a database. The backend technology choice significantly impacts performance, security, maintainability, and development speed.

Key considerations:
- Performance requirements for handling multiple concurrent users
- Type safety to reduce runtime errors
- Maintainability and readability of codebase
- Developer productivity and ecosystem
- Future scalability needs

## Decision
We will use Rust with the Axum web framework for the backend implementation.

### Technology Stack Details:
- **Language**: Rust 2024 Edition
- **Web Framework**: Axum 0.8
- **Runtime**: Tokio 1.x with full async support
- **Database Access**: SQLx for type-safe SQL queries
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## Consequences

### Advantages:
1. **Performance**: Rust provides near-native performance with minimal overhead, which will support efficient API processing and data manipulation.
2. **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents common memory-related bugs and security vulnerabilities.
3. **Type Safety**: Strong static typing catches errors at compile time rather than runtime.
4. **Concurrency**: Tokio runtime provides excellent support for asynchronous operations and concurrent request handling.
5. **Modern API Design**: Axum offers a modern, Tower-based middleware approach with excellent ergonomics.
6. **Growing Ecosystem**: The Rust ecosystem for web development is maturing rapidly with high-quality libraries.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Learning Curve**: Rust has a steeper learning curve compared to languages like JavaScript or Python.
2. **Development Speed**: Initial development may be slower due to Rust's strict compiler and ownership model.
3. **Ecosystem Maturity**: While growing rapidly, the Rust web ecosystem is not as mature as Node.js or Java.
4. **Hiring Pool**: Smaller pool of developers with Rust experience compared to more mainstream languages.

### Mitigations:
1. Provide comprehensive documentation and coding standards to assist developers
2. Implement shared utilities and abstractions to simplify common tasks
3. Establish mentoring for team members new to Rust
4. Create reusable components to accelerate development

## Alternatives Considered

### Node.js with Express/Nest.js
- **Pros**: Large ecosystem, faster initial development, larger talent pool
- **Cons**: Runtime type errors, lower performance, less memory safety
- **Reason for rejection**: Performance concerns for data processing and lack of type safety

### Go with Gin/Echo
- **Pros**: Good performance, simple language, good concurrency model
- **Cons**: Less expressive type system, less memory safety than Rust
- **Reason for rejection**: Rust offers better type safety and memory safety guarantees

### Java/Kotlin with Spring Boot
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, good enterprise support, strong typing
- **Cons**: Heavier runtime overhead, slower startup time
- **Reason for rejection**: Performance overhead and complexity of the Spring ecosystem

- ADR-003: Selection of PostgreSQL for database (complementary decision)
- ADR-005: Layered architecture approach (influenced by Rust's module system)

## Notes
This decision should be revisited if:
- The team experiences significant productivity challenges with Rust
- Critical libraries or tools become unavailable or unmaintained
- Performance requirements change significantly
