# Architecture Decision Record: Layered Architecture Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Subscription Service Management Panel requires a well-structured architecture that promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability. The architectural approach impacts development productivity, code organization, and the system's ability to evolve over time.

Key considerations:
- Separation of concerns
- Code organization and maintainability
- Testability of components
- Scalability requirements
- Development team collaboration
- Future extensibility

## Decision
We will implement a layered architecture pattern for both the backend and frontend components of the application.

### Backend Architecture Layers:
1. **API Layer**: Request handling, routing, and response formatting
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
3. **Repository Layer**: Data access and persistence
4. **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and logic
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns and external integrations

### Frontend Architecture Layers:
1. **UI Layer**: Components and pages
2. **State Management Layer**: Application state and logic
3. **Service Layer**: API communication and data transformation
4. **Utility Layer**: Helper functions and shared utilities

## Consequences

### Advantages:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different aspects of the application.
2. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with appropriate mocking.
3. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on other layers.
4. **Scalability**: Different layers can be scaled independently if needed.
5. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams or developers can work on different layers concurrently.
6. **Dependency Management**: Dependencies flow in one direction, reducing coupling.
7. **Consistent Structure**: Provides a consistent mental model for the codebase.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Overhead**: Can introduce additional code and complexity for simple operations.
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the layered approach and boundaries.
3. **Potential Over-engineering**: Risk of creating unnecessary abstractions.
4. **Performance Impact**: Multiple layers can add slight performance overhead.

### Mitigations:
1. Establish clear guidelines for what belongs in each layer
2. Create templates and examples for common patterns
3. Allow for pragmatic exceptions when the layered approach adds unnecessary complexity
4. Regular architecture reviews to prevent over-engineering

## Alternatives Considered

### Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Independent deployment, technology diversity, strong isolation
- **Cons**: Increased operational complexity, distributed system challenges
- **Reason for rejection**: Unnecessary complexity for the current scale and requirements

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, good for reactive systems, scalability
- **Cons**: More complex to reason about, eventual consistency challenges
- **Reason for rejection**: Not required for the current use cases, can be incorporated later if needed

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Pros**: Strong alignment with business domain, rich domain model
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, steeper learning curve
- **Reason for rejection**: Full DDD approach would be overkill, though some concepts are incorporated

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simplicity, easier deployment, shared codebase
- **Cons**: Less separation, potential scaling limitations, tighter coupling
- **Reason for rejection**: Lacks the clear separation of concerns needed for maintainability

## Related Decisions
- ADR-001: Selection of Rust with Axum for backend (influences layer implementation)
- ADR-002: Selection of React with TypeScript for frontend (influences component architecture)
- ADR-003: Selection of PostgreSQL for database (influences repository layer)
- ADR-004: JWT for authentication (influences cross-cutting concerns)

## Notes
This decision should be revisited if:
- The application grows significantly in complexity
- Performance bottlenecks emerge from the layered approach
- Team feedback indicates issues with the architecture
- New requirements suggest a different architectural pattern would be more suitable
