# Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Subscription Service Management Panel is a web application that helps users track and manage their subscription services. The system will allow users to add, remove, or pause subscriptions, set payment periods, and view statistics on subscription costs over time.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and User Authentication (4 weeks)
- Set up project infrastructure (Rust backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database)
- Implement user authentication system (registration, login, password reset)
- Create user profile management
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Subscription Management System (5 weeks)
- Implement subscription data model and repository
- Create subscription CRUD operations
- Implement subscription cycle calculations
- Build subscription management UI
- Add payment record tracking

### Phase 3: Statistics and Reporting (4 weeks)
- Implement statistical calculations for expenses
- Create data visualization components
- Add export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- Build statistics dashboard

### Phase 4: Finalization and Security (3 weeks)
- Implement notification system
- Enhance security measures
- Optimize performance
- Prepare for deployment
- Conduct comprehensive testing

### Phase 5: Future Improvements (Post-Launch)
- Third-party API integrations
- Payment gateway integration
- Mobile application
- Advanced analytics
- Social features

## Critical Path Dependencies
1. Authentication system must be completed before subscription management
2. Subscription management must be completed before statistics and reporting
3. All core features must be completed before finalization and security enhancements

## Key Milestones
- End of Week 4: Authentication system completed
- End of Week 9: Subscription management system completed
- End of Week 13: Statistics and reporting completed
- End of Week 16: Production-ready application

## Resource Requirements
- Backend: Rust developers with Axum experience
- Frontend: React developers with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS experience
- Database: PostgreSQL expertise
- DevOps: CI/CD pipeline setup and maintenance
- QA: Testing and security validation

## Risk Assessment
1. **Learning curve for Rust development**
   - Impact: Medium
   - Probability: High
   - Mitigation: Allocate extra time for learning, use established libraries

2. **Security vulnerabilities in authentication**
   - Impact: High
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Follow security best practices, conduct security review

3. **Complex subscription cycle calculations**
   - Impact: Medium
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing with various scenarios

4. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Impact: High
   - Probability: Medium
   - Mitigation: Optimize queries, implement caching, use efficient data structures

## Success Criteria
- All features implemented according to specifications
- Code passes all tests with >90% coverage
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- User feedback is positive (>4/5 rating)
